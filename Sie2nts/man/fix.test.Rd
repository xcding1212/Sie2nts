\title{The Test of Stability for Auto-Regressive (AR) Approximations With Fixed Parameters}
\usage{
fix.test(ts, c, b, type, or = 4, B.s = 1000, m = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{ts}{ts is the data set which is a time series data typically}

\item{c}{c indicates the number of basis used to estimate (For wavelet, the number of basis is 2^c. If
Cspli is chosen, the real number of basis is c-2+or)}

\item{b}{b is the lag for auto-regressive model}

\item{type}{type indicates which type of basis is used. There are 31 types in this package}

\item{or}{indicates the order of spline and only used in Cspli type, default is 4 which indicates cubic spline}

\item{B.s}{the number of statistics used in multiplier bootstrap, the default value is 1000}

\item{m}{the number of window size used in multiplier bootstrap, the default value is 0 which uses the
minimum volatility method to determine the number}
}
\value{
p value of the test
}
\description{
fix.test() generates a test of Stability for AR Approximations with fixed parameters.
