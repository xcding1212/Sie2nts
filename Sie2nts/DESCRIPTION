Description: This package for auto-regressive approximations to non-stationary time series.
    Estimate coefficients for non-stationary time series via the method of sieves. 
    Provide A high dimensional test basis on multiplier bootstrap procedure and the test of 
    lags of auto-regressive model for the inference of the AR approximation coefficients. 
    Visualize the performance of estimations, PACF in 3 dimensions and the basis functions.In addition, 
    this package also contains Daubechies and Coiflet father wavelet value table and the code to generate 
    them for convenience purposes.
